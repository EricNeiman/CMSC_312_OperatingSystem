Operating System Simulator

This operating system simulator can take user inputs to create processes as well as read a file from a user input path.
From there the simulator can run all of the processes in a Round Robin scheduler until all of the simulated processes are finished.

inputs:
help -> brings up the help help menu
create process -> brings up the user process creation menu
add <path to file> -> takes a file path and then parses the file for processes to create
run -> runs all of the processes stored into the ready queue in a round robin scheduler
exit -> exits the program
